        article = self.input['body'].lower()
        tokens = smart_tokenizer.SmartTokenizer(article)
        self.clean = tokens.tokensSS()
        self.no_rep = Set(self.clean)

    def rank(self):
        diff = len(self.no_rep) - len(self.clean)
        return int((diff/len(self.clean)) * 100)
```
